My fork of LOIc.

I know C#, and how to structure programs in it.

Things to do to this code first.
The method (http,udp,tcp) is used as a string and as an int. Use an enum!

There is lots of code in the main form that has nothing to do with visual state, including irc control processing and resulting state. Factor out into classes (one for state, one for processing commands).


Consider a common interface for XXPFlooder and HTTPFlooder. Adding more classes that do similar things is a logical extension point.
