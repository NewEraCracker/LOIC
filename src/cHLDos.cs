	/// <summary>
	/// ReCoil basically does a "reverse" DDOS
	/// Requirements: the targeted "file" has to be larger than 24 KB (bigger IS better ;) !)
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// it sends a complete legimit request but throttles the download down to nearly nothing .. just enough to keep the connection alive
	/// the attack-method is basically the same as slowloris ... bind the socket as long as possible and eat up as much as you can
	/// apache servers crash nearly in an instant. this attack however can NOT be mitigated with http-ready and mods like that.
	/// this attack simulates sth like a massive amount of mobile devices running shortly out of coverage (like driving through a tunnel)
	///
	/// due to the nature of the congestian-response this could maybe taken a step further to self-feeding congestion-cascades
	/// if done "properly" in a distributed manner together with packet-floods.(??)
	///
	/// Limitations / Disadvantages:
	/// this does NOT work if you are behind anything like a proxy / caching-stuff.
	/// in this implementation however we are bound to the underlying system-/net-buffers ...
	/// due to that the required size of the targeted file differs -.-
	/// Dataflow: {NET} --> {WINSOCK-Buffer} --> ClientSocket .. so we have to make sure the actual data exceeds
	/// the winsock-buffer + clientsocket-buffer, but we can ONLY change the latter.
	/// from what i could find on a brief search / test the winsock buffer for a 10/100 links lies around 16-18KB
	/// where 1 GBit links have an underlying buffer around 64KB (size really does matter :P )
	///
	/// what to target?:
	/// although it might makes sense to target pictures or other large files on the server this doesn't really makes sense!
	/// the server could (and in most cases does - except for apache) always read directly from the file-stream resulting in nearly 0 needed RAM
	/// --> always target dynamic content! this has to be generated on the fly / pulled fom a DB
	/// and therefor most likely ends up in the RAM!
	///
	/// high-value targets / worst case szenario:
	/// as it seems the echo statement in php writes directly to the socket .. considering this it should be possible to
	/// take down the back-end infrastructure if the page does an early flush causing the congestation while still holding DB-conns etc.
