## HIVEMIND/HIDDEN MODE

HIVEMIND mode will connect your client to an IRC server so it can be controlled remotely.
Think of this as a voluntary botnet. Please be aware that your client can potentially be
made to do naughty things.

Note: It does NOT allow remote administration of your machine; it
just providees control of LOIC itself.

If you want to start up in Hivemind mode, run something such as this:

```
	LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address
```

which will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:6667/loic

You can also specify a port and channel:

```
	LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address 1234 #secret
```

which will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:1234/secret

In order to run Hivemind Hidden mode, run something such as this:

```
	LOIC.exe /hidden /hivemind irc.server.address
```

which will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:6667/loic without any visible GUI.

## CONTROLLING LOIC FROM IRC

As an OP, Admin or Owner, set the channel topic or send a message such as the following:

```
	!lazor targetip=127.0.0.1 message=test_test port=80 method=tcp wait=false random=true
```

To start an attack, type:

```
	!lazor start
```

or append "start" to the END of the topic:

```
	!lazor targetip=127.0.0.1 message=test_test port=80 method=tcp wait=false random=true start
```

To reset LOIC's options back to their defaults:

```
	!lazor default
```

To stop an attack:

```
	!lazor stop
```

and **be sure to remove "start" from the END of the topic**, if it exists, as well.

Take a look at the source code for more details.
